        <h1 class="middle">About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! I am Ruben Becks, 17 years old and I live in Arnemuiden. I live with my mother, father and little brother. My hobbies are playing guitar, watching F1, nerding about the Tolkien Universe, producing music and gaming. The guitars are listed below. I produce music with FL Studio and some 3rd party plugins. And my favourite games are Horizon Forbidden West, GTA5, Minecraft, Subnautica, Elden Ring, Geometry Dash, Gran Turismo 7 and Assetto Corsa.</p>
        <p>Something important you should know about me is that I have Asperger's, a form of autism, which causes my fine motor skills to be relatively lacking compared to most people and that I sometimes kind of wander off into my own thoughts. But those issues are relatively minor nowadays, and it doesn't bother me anymore, with the exception of drawing which I have some difficulty with.</p>
        <p>During the vacations/breaks, I work at a company called <a target="_blank" href="https://rounded.com?sl=en"><span class="marker">Rounded</span></a>. We are a company that supplies device parts for devices like phones, tablets, coffee machines and gaming consoles. It's a really nice place since it's a small company and we're only with 3 people in the department I work in, so it's very relaxed. It's also work that fits me perfectly since you need to be very exact, which I personally excel at.</p>
        <p>Music has been one of my greatest passions since I was about 8 years old, and when I turned 10 years old I got a guitar for my birthday, and I was over the moon. Now, 7 years later, I have a whole bunch of guitars and I also produce, which I have been doing since 2020.</p>
        <p>Here is one of my songs:</p>
