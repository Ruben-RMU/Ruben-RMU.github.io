      <h1 class="title">The ICT field of work</h1>
      <p>
        The ICT field of work is incredibly huge, but since this page can only hold so much I'll try to summarize it as much as possible.<br>
        There are 3 main areas: Software/Web Development, IT Consultancy and Data Science.<br>
        Software/Web Development is, as the name says, busy with the developing of applications, websites, etc. You mainly have to have a lot
        of skill in coding and algorithmic thinking.
        Data Science is very complex, but to keep it short, its main focus is converting data into real knowledge. You once again have to be
        very skilled in algorithmic thinking, but even more thant software/web development, since you constantly have to answer critical questions.<br>
        IT Consultancy's main focus is giving advice to companies about how they can best implement IT for reaching their goals. For this you
        have to be very good at giving advice and implementing those advices.<br>
        Oh, and before anyone says that I forgot AI, it's pretty much just software development since AI is just a bunch of glorified if-statements.
