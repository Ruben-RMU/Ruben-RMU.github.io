      <p>
        Personally I have a lot of strengths, namely: I am a very kind person, I like helping people and I am very honest. I can also learn very quickly.<br>
        But coming back to the honesty part, sometimes I can be a bit too honest and that ends up weirding people out sometimes. And because of my Asperger's,
        I can sometimes work very hastily and sometimes I am easily distracted.<br><br>
        I see a lot of opportunities in this study, namely learning more about coding in both familiar and new languages, learning more about how computers work
        and how everything interacts with eachother and constantly setting the bar higher for myself.<br>
        However there are some threats I see. The primary one being having to deal with a lot of stuff at once and overwhelming myself with work. But I constantly
        try to reassure myself that if I start learning on time and do my assignments on time, everything will go smoothlhy.
