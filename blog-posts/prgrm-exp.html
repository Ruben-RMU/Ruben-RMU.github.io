      <h1 class="title">My Programming Experience</h1>
      <p>When I was 8, I got a LEGO Mindstorms set which is a lego set which has a programmable driving block which you
        could program using an app. Not with code, but with blocks like loops and stuff. I was really interested by it and
        when I eventually got into high school, I took programming classes for the first 3 years where I learned the
        basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. In the last 3 years I took ICT classes where I learned about computer's
        insides, Python, PHP, more HTML, more CSS and even some SQL. It was also the subject I scored highest on for my diploma.</p>
