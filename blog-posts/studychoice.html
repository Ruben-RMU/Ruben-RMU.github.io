      <h1 class="title">Why did I choose for HBO-ICT?</h1>
      <p>The reason why I chose for ICT was because I am really in love with computers. From a young age, I have been fascinated by them since they seemed
        to work like magic; the way everything worked together was just really interesting to me. From hardware to software, every single part of a computer
        interests me.<br><br>
        In addition to that, coding became a big interest in me at a bit of a later age. I've always enjoyed learning (new) programming languages.
        It's like learning a (new) language; everything seems new and exciting, but when you learn it it's really hard most of the time. However,
        with time you become more and more skilled and fluent in it and eventually speaking it becomes second nature for you.<br><br>
        In conclusion: Choosing ICT was not just a choice I made randomly, it came from years of interest in computers and coding.
